## About

PistonQueue is a basic and easy to use queue plugin designed for anarchy and survival servers. This plugin is a fork
of LeeesBungeeQueue but LeeesBungeeQueue was a designed more for the server 6b6t.org, so a fork of the plugin was created
that is designed for everyone and has more updates and support.

## Features

### Tablist

A much more easy to use tablist compared to the old one.

### Server ping information and a custom protocol

### Custom Kick Messages

For example the "You have lost connection to the server" message you see on the server 2b2t.org.

### Custom Server Offline Messages

Instead of showing an error saying the server is down you can customize this message to whatever message you want.

### Auth server support

Auth server support for cracked (offline mode: false) servers. You can now have the authserver go first and then the queue!
