# About
XeraBungeeQueue is a basic and easy to use queue plugin designed for anarchy and survival servers. This plugin is a fork of LeeesBungeeQueue but LeeesBungeeQueue was a designed more for the server 6b6t.org so a fork of the plugin was created that is designed for everyone and has more updates and support.
# Features
# Tablist 
A much more easy to use tablist compared to the old one.

# Custom Kick Messages
For example the "You have lost connection to the server" message you see on the server 2b2t.org.
# Custom Server Offline Messages 
Instead of showing an error saying the server is down you can customize this message to whatever message you want.
# Auth server support
Auth server support for cracked (offline mode: false) servers. (This is causes some security issues for example: The queue goes first then auth and main.).
