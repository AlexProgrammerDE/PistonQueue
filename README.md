## About

PistonQueue is a basic and easy to use queue plugin designed for anarchy and survival servers. 
This plugin is a fork of LeeesBungeeQueue, which is very custom and does lack many features. 
This fork aims at providing more features and a more stable queue system.

## Features

* BungeeCord and Velocity support.
* Queue system with reserved slots.
* Shadow-banning players.
* Built-in support for forcing people into the end void.
* Auth server support for cracked (offline mode: false) servers. 
* Joining the auth server first before the queue server.

## Setup

Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/AlexProgrammerDE/PistonQueue/wiki) for a tutorial on how to set up PistonQueue.
