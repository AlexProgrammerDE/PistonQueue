**⏰️ Powerful queue plugin for anarchy/survival servers.**

## About

PistonQueue is a powerful, but easy to use queue plugin designed for anarchy and survival servers.
It is a recreation of the 2b2t.org queue system design, but adds a lot of features on top.

## Features

* BungeeCord and Velocity support.
* Queue system with reserved slots.
* Shadow-banning players.
* Built-in support for forcing people into the end void.
* Auth server support for cracked (offline mode: false) servers. 
* Joining the auth server first before the queue server.

## Setup

Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/AlexProgrammerDE/PistonQueue/wiki) for a tutorial on how to set up PistonQueue.
